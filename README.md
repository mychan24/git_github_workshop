# **Git**

# 1. Setting up git
## 1.1  Download git

* Mac Users: https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Windows User: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.23.0.windows.1
	

## 1.2 Configuring git 
This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity, which means that any changes pushed to GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab or another Git host server in a later lesson will include this information.

### Setup username and email
> git config --global user.name "Your Name"

> git config --global user.email "Your Email"


### Setup the correct linebreaks encoding depending on your OS
**Mac/Linux**
> git config --global core.autocrlf input

**Windows**
> git config --global core.autocrlf true

### Setup "nano" as the text editor to interface with git
> git config --global core.editor "nano -w"

### Check to ensure settings are correct
> git config --list

# 2. Creating a Repository (`git init`)
## 2.1 Create a directory in your Desktop for this workshop
```
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir workdir
cd workdir	
```

## 2.2 Create a repository, where git store versions of your file
```
git init
```

Check that a hidden folder `.git` has been created
> ls -a 

Check the status of git
> git status

# 3. Tracking Changes (`git add & commit`)

## 3.1 Adding new files/modification to staging area (`git add`)
Make sure you are in the correct directory
> cd ~/Desktop/workdir

Make a new file `foo.txt`
> touch foo.txt

Check the status
> git status

If there are **untracked files**, we would like to add those files so git will track their changes:
> git add foo.txt

Check the status again, `foo.txt` should now be ready to get committed (a commit is a revision to your files).
> git status

## 3.2 Saving these changes to the repository (`git commit`)

Commit the file and note the identifier for this commit (e.g., `f22b25e`):
> git commit -m "Add foo.txt to repo"

What have we done so far? Lets check the log, which list all the commits made so far. 
> git log

## BONUS - Checking what has changed before add/commit (`git diff`)
Add some text to the file `foo.txt`
> echo hello >> foo.txt

Check what has changed between your last commit and now:
> git diff

Add & commit your changes to `foo.txt`
> git add foo.txt

> git commit -m "Add hello in foo.txt"

Check the status and log again (`git status` and `git log`)

###  Notes

* Git does not track an empty directory, so until a directory has a file in it, git would not track it. 
* `git add` adds file to a **staging area**, and `git commit` save these changes in the staging area to the repository.



# 4. Exploring History (`git diff & show`)
## 4.1 Difference between current file and N commit ago (`git diff HEAD`)
Lets add another line to `foo.txt`
> echo world >> foo.txt

Check what is different from your current version of foo.txt compare to the last commit
> git diff HEAD foo.txt

Check difference compare to two commits ago
> git diff HEAD~1 foo.txt

Check difference against a specific commit based on identifer (the unique identifier is different for you, use `git log` to check!)
> git diff 7be71q foo.txt 

## 4.2 What was done in ____ commit? (`git show`)
Sometimes we want to check what was done during a certain commit (instead of comparing differences)
> commit show HEAD~1 foo.txt

# 5. Reverting to a previous commit (`git checkout`)
## 5.1 Going back to a specific version of a file (`git checkout`)
Before going back to a previous state of a file, COMMIT what you have now
> git add foo.txt

> git commit -m "Add world"


Recover the `foo.txt` that doesn't have "world" in it (use HEAD~1 or unique identifier)
> git checkout HEAD~1 foo.txt

Check what is in `foo.txt`
> cat foo.txt

Go back to the state where "world" was in the file
> git checkout HEAD foo.txt


## 5.2 Going back to an entire commit - Detached HEAD (CAUTION)
If you `git checkout` a previous commit without also specifying a file, you will revert the entire directory to a previous condition
> git checkout HEAD~1 

You should get a message like this
```
You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

 git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
```

Use `git checkout HEAD` to return to most recent state. IF you checkout a previous commit without first committing your current state, then anything not committed would be lost!!!


# 6. Telling git to ignore certain files
Make a file named `.gitignore` (you can also use nano/any-text-editor to do it)
> touch ignore_this.txt
> echo ignore_this.txt >> .gitignore

Try `git add ignore_this.txt`, and you will see git will not add it. 

If you want to `add` a suppsoedly ignored file, use `-f`
> git add -f ignore_this.txt


# **Github and other remote hosts**
Thus far everything is within your local computer and done using `git`. That is the **version control** portion of git. Which is important and powerful. But what makes git a very strong tool for collaboration is sharing through remote hosts like Github (or other remote hosts).

* Github is not the only option, there are other companies that offer free remote hosting, here are a few alterantives (Bitbucket)[https://bitbucket.org/], (Gitlab)[https://gitlab.com/]

# 7. Storing codes on Github
## 7.1 Create a remote repository 
* In https://github.com/<username>
	+ Click **Repositories** tab
	+ Click **New*
	+ Enter workdir as the Repository name, click **Create repository**
* You now have an empty remote repository and some instructions to populate it

## 7.2 Push an existing repository from your local computer
Go back to the loacl directory, workdir that we made in previous sections. 
> cd ~/Desktop/workdir

Add the github repo you just made as a remote repository that you want to push your data to
> git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/workdir.git

Push your local repository to your Github
> git push â€“u origin master

## BONUS - SSH keys
Here is a link to help you setup using SSH keys for authentication with Github
https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account


# 8. Getting a repository from Github (fork & `git clone`)
## 8.1 Fork a repository (remote -> remote)
**fork** means you copy someone's Github repository and putting it in your Github 

this repository that you are reading this README file into your github.

* Click the <Fork> icon near the top right corner 
* It will take a little while to load
* And then you should be redirected to a copy of the same repository in YOUR Github account

## 8.2 Cloning a repository (remote -> local)
**clone**  means you copy a remote repo onto your local computer 

Clone YOUR git_github_workshop repository onto your local computer: 
> git clone https://github.com/<username>/git_github_workshop.git ~/Desktop/git_github_workshop


# 9. Collaborating (`git fetch & pull`)

## 9.1 Setup a fake collaborator, yourself in another directory :) 

Clone the **workdir** repo into your local computer but a different folder as if you have a collaborator
> git clone https://github.com/<username>/workdir.git ~/Desktop/workdir_fake_collab
	
Lets pretend you are the collaborator, and you will make some changes and push it to Github
```
cd ~/Desktop/workdir_fake_collab
touch foofoo.txt
git add foofoo.txt
git commit -m "Add foofoo.txt"
git push origin master
```

Lets check what is in the current folder 
> ls

Check what is on the workdir repository on Github. It should contain `foofoo.txt`

But what about the original `workdir` folder? 
```
cd ~/Desktop/workdir
ls
```

`foofoo.txt` should be missing. Now lets say you want to check what changes your collaborator made. 

## 9.2 Implement the changes your fake collaborator made

**fetch** the changes your fake collaborator pushed to Github onto your local computer. 
> git fetch

NOTE that this does not change the files in your directory. But now you can use `git diff` to see what your collaborator has changed
> git diff master origin/master

If you decided these are changes you want in your local directory (the origainl `workdir`)
> git pull

### Notes
* `git pull` returns message "Already up to date."
	+ `git pull` impelment the changes that were fetched by `git fetch`, so fetch first. 
* Will `git fetch` change my stuff? 
	+ Fetching does not change your local file until your pull. 

### BONUS - What is my remote?
What is your remote? 
> git remote -v

Adding a different remote
> git add remote [name] [url]

Changing the URL of the remote (e.g., you change the remote repository)
> git remote set-url [name] [newurl]


## 9.3 Really collaborating on Github

* Adding collaborators in your Github repository
	+ Click **Settings**
	+ Click **Collaborators** and add them (they need to be on Github)
	
* More Advance way to collaborate (won't cover in detail)
	+ Fork a repository you want to make changes 
	+ Clone it to your local computer
	+ Make changes, push it to your forked repo
	+ Make a Pull Request in the original repository
